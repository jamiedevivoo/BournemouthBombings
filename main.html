            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
              Ron Jenkinson was born in Bournemouth in 1933. He was playing
              outside the front of the house with his brother at the time. It
              was lunchtime, the town was teeming, people were just getting
              ready for have their sunday roast. It was likely that these
              attacks were carefully planned, strategic raids were carried out
              by pilots who were experienced in attacking at high speed. Despite
              being three to four miles away from the central attacks, Ron was
              able to hear the bombs land. He later learned that the Metropole
              was attacked which housed several canadian soldiers who were
              killed. His childhood consisted of watching the dog fights that
              occured in the skies above him, witnessing plane engines on fire
              and crashing to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              George Perrin was born in Portsmouth in 1932. As a child he was
              evacuated and forced to live with a lady who he despised, and who
              did not treat him well shortly after moving to bournemouth. Like
              Ron, George was able to hear the explosions which occured miles
              away. Him and his friend went on their bikes to ride down to the
              Metropole where they witnessed the awful damage of the bombings.
              Despite the dead bodies being moved, the carnage still remained.

                Aside from two years in which I was living in Califonina I've
                lived in Bournemouth my entire life. I was 9 years old when the
                bombs were dropped on the Metropole.

              I lived in Ensbury Park in the North Western corner of
              Bournemouth. I remember playing out in the drive with my brother
              at the time. I remember the violent explosions, even at 3-4 miles
              away. We later learned that it was the Metropole Hotel, and that
              load of Canadian soldiers had been killed.

              I feel like that raid did have quite an effect on all of us; there
              were a lot of Canadians staying in the Metropole that were trying
              to help us during the war. So in a way I think it brought the two
              countries closer together really. The Bournemouth people all had a
              lot of consideration and respect for the Canadians that got
              killed. So I suppose it helped in that way, but it was a tragedy.
              I think it did cement relations, people felt a lot of sympathy for
              the Canadians after this happened.

              Now this didn't take place on the 23rd of May but it does help to
              paint a picture of wartime Bournemouth. I remember the Alma Road
              School. One night my dad was on ARP duty and he came running in
              and said “There’s a landmine coming down”. When that hit that was
              a terrific explosion and that was 2 miles away from where we were
              and that flattened the school and damaged many of the buildings in
              the area. Can you imagine the chaos caused by loads of them
              dropping. Especially during the day, that's why the Metropole was
              so devastating.

              I was used to seeing planes flying through Bournemouth. I remember
              we used to watch fighter planes dog fights over Bournemouth, with
              planes you couldn't always see them, but you could always hear the
              machine guns constantly going. I used to go out as a child to Hurn
              Airport and I’d sit on the end of the runway and watch the bombers
              come in from Berlin.

                I was 11 years old when the bombs were dropped on Bournemouth. I
                didn’t know what had happened, until the local bus driver told
                me. So we got on our bikes and cycled down there.

                I can remember the raid on the metropolitan hotel, very well. I
                could hear the explosion from where I lived on the Ringwood
                Road. My mate and I, a chap named Johnny Doe, jumped on our
                bikes and rode down to the Metropole and saw the damage and it
                was horrendous. The bodies were moved but you could still see
                the carnage of what had happened down there.

              It didn’t affect me, I wasn’t frightened, I wasn’t that type of

              just accepted it, I wasn’t scared at all. It was just one of those
              things that we had to deal with, that didn't change throughout the

              The Second World War involved 61 countries and over 30 million
              soldiers, it was a global event that had devastating consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite its scale, many aren't aware of how it affected everyday
              peoples lives. One reason that has been given for this is that
              technology has distracted people from reality.

                131 men and women are confirmed to have lost their lives on that
                day, though the total deathtoll is thought to be somewhere over
                200. Hundreds more suffered life changing injuries.
              </li>
              <li>
                22 buildings were destroyed in the raid, the Metropole in
                Lansdowne and Central Hotel at thebottom of Richmond Hill.
              </li>
              <li>
                3359 Buildings were damaged in some shape or form leading to 37

              <li>
                On the 23rd of May 1943 the air raid sirens sounded at 12.54pm,
                with the first bomb dropping seconds before the clocks struck 1.
                Bournemouth was blindsided as the authorities normally gave a
                full 22 minutes of warning upon detection of enemy aircraft.

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
              John Creswell was only four in 1943 when the Metropole bombings
              began. He was just a child, sitting in his back garden when he
              witnessed planes fly across the skyline. There had been no air
              raid warning, but him and a few others decided to immediately go
              to the raid shelter. After staying some time, they eventurally
              left and could see smoke rise from Bournemouth center. He recounts
              it being one of the worst sights anyone could have witnessed. Most
              of the air raids would be at night time, and so as a child he was
              not concious of a mid-day attack. This event in partiuclar had a
              deep affect on John, as he can still remember the bombings vividly
              today. The main attack which is widely remembered is of the
              Metropole hotel, however 24 other bombs had also been dropped,
              causing wide-spread destruction across bournemouth. As a
              historian, his research found that the pilots had a plan of places
              they targetted to bomb, all of them being large buildings where
              many people were present. This bombings still resonate today with
              the reminders of war torn buildings.

              My name is John Creswell, in 1943 I was 4 years old and I
              witnessed the air raid on Bournemouth on May 23rd. Me and my
              immediate family were sitting in our back garden of our house in
              Southbourne when suddenly we saw a whole load of planes going
              across the skyline. One of our colleagues recognised them as
              German planes, and we all went into the air raid shelter
              immediately. There had been no air raid warning and it was only
              after we got the all clear that we came out again and apparently
              the whole road were looking westward to see the smoke rising from
              Bournemouth centre. It had been the worst raid on Bournemouth. It
              was a daylight raid and it was the worst one on Bournemouth.

              I’m lucky enough to be able to say I don’t know anyone that lost
              their lives that day. I did know a neighbour that was affected by
              the bombings, her store (Bobby’s) was bombed. She used to work
              there, they had a sale after it was bombed. She would’ve had to
              help out with the sale and then clear off and man herself.
            </p>

            <p>
              The closest bomb would’ve been about 3 miles away, we never
              actually heard the bombs fall or anything like that. Technically
              they were quite low weight bombs, but because they were so
              accurately aimed they caused the huge destruction.
            </p>

            <p>
              luckily the raid didn't affect us to much because we didn’t really
              use the centre, at the time you didn’t travel to far away. We got
              our shopping locally and didn’t do any serious shopping like
              people do today, so we didn’t have any knowledge of what happened
              in the square. We had to rely on the newspapers to get
              information.

              The Metropole is the only raid that I remember well, though there
              were plenty of air raids. Most of them were night time raids so
              they didn’t really affect us, apart from a few incendiary bombs.
              So I was never really conscious of any other bombing during the
              war. However because this has been so etched in the psyche of
              everyone that lived in Bournemouth and Poole at the time we all
              recognised it for the great destruction it caused.
            </p>

            <p>
              On that particular day the bombing was quite wide ranging,
              everyone concentrates on the Metropole hotel as being the main
              event, but there were at least 24 other bombs which were dropped.
              Ranging from Queens Park all the way along through Boscombe,
              coming up to Lansdowne and then towards Grand Central. Considering
              the radius that the bombs fell, it would seem the Germans had some
              concept of what they were going to bomb, and that is; large corner
              building several stories high with domes on top. There were three
              such places and they all got bombed. The Metropole was the main
              one, it was the first one on their route, they went down, bombed
              Beales (the store), and then they went on to go to Central hotel
              where there were more known casualty’s than the Metropole. The
              reason you hear about the metropole was because most of the
              casualties were air force personnel, and that got kept secret at
              the time. We still don’t know what the true figures were, the true
              casualties, and by that I mean death that the Metropole was.

              They were a different breed to the normal type of bomber that we’d
              experienced before the blitz. Whereas before the war, the Germans
              had developed very fast fighter bombers, that could creep in very
              quickly. They were a one engine job. I don’t think it could outrun
              a spitfire, but because they came in under the radar by the time
              the spitfires had come to attack them they were too far across the
              channel to attack. There was one instance in which one was shot
              down; though there’s a bit of doubt over whether it was shot down
              by a spitfire or an anti-air gun. But basically they came in
              dropped their bombs and flew out as they only had one bomb. These
              were called tip and run raids, and they were practising these all
              down the south coast of England. The same day as the Metropole
              there was a raid on Hastings, but they just used 26 of these
              planes, they flew in and flew out again.
            </p>

            <p>
              I think the shape of the German bombers made them more
              recognisable; Germans tended to be more angled, they looked very
              different to the Americans planes that we’d occasionally see
              flying over. These were new beasts though so people weren’t as
              aware of them. An ordinary person probably wouldn’t have
              recognised them. They had an insignia but you needed to be quite
              close up to see it.

              I think on this occasion the Germans had a specific reason to bomb
              Bournemouth. There are a lot of conspiracy theories going on as to
              what and why they attacked. One of the theories is that the three
              places I mentioned were not the only places bombed. There was a
              coach firm up on Holdenhurst road, which got very seriously
              damaged; it was thought that they were making torpedoes up there.
              So that could very well have been the target. But my personal
              theory is that three of the buildings hit all had a very similar
              shape, and were located on Junctions. They were quite tall and
              they were hotels with military servicemen held up.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was well known that various servicemen were stationed in
              Bournemouth. We had quite a bit of the American army and Canadian
              Air Force staying here. The Germans probably did know about us. In
              a previous raid we had Lord HawHaw who was the sort of propaganda
              English person on German radio, he’d mentioned an Anglo smith
              hotel that was going to be bombed so they must have known that
              servicemen were staying here. Lot of places that got hit in this
              and other raids were obviously aimed at personnel. But otherwise a
              lot of the bombing was random.

          <div class="transcript storySection">
            <p>
              As Bobby’s (The Store) was concerned they bounced back quite
              quickly in the square. The Shamrock and Rambler coach station got
              rebuilt quite quickly. But the hotels themselves were left
              derelict until way after the war. Beale’s was totally operational
              again. It was the middle of the 1950s before the Metropole became
              the Kentucky fried chicken place. There was a great reluctance to
              rebuild things like hotels because they’d served their purpose
              during and before the war. Because they were a luxury and more
              people wanted houses, all the concentration was on rebuilding
              homes for soldiers when they returned.
            </p>

            <p>
              As far as any bombing raid was concerned, they didn’t rebuild much
              during the war. There wasn’t much effort to rebuild places unless
              they were very important. And because during and even after the
              war there was a shortage of building resources, the concentration
              was primarily on houses and very important places. So places of
              entertainment or leisure were very low on the list so it probably
              took quite a while for Bournemouth to reinstate itself as a
              holiday resort.

              As far as Bournemouth is concerned locally bombing was very
              restricted. Most of the Germans were still attacking the Russians,
              and the eastern front. So all we were getting were rather, smaller
              fighter bombers used in raids, and as far as Bournemouth is
              concerned this was raid number 48. Of 50, 51 raids altogether. By
              this time in the war we had very few raids. And this was one of
              two hit and run raids in this area, in Bournemouth. Technically
              they were very small scale raids, the damage as you can still see
              from the pictures were devastating.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ve said from the beginning, anyone that remembers that raid
              remembers that, and probably not any of the others. Which is even
              though, there family were killed or injured this is the raid that
              really impacts with everybody and still resonates with us.
            </p>

            <p>
              I think that younger people unless you’ve experienced what
              happened in the war, or actually experienced bombing. They have no
              real concept and I think it’s a tragedy that we can watch the
              people in Syria, and not realise the agony that the people there
              must be going through due to constant bombing. We never had that
              sort of affect in this country, not to the consistency that we see
              today. When a bomb fell we just carried on afterwards, it was
              affectively the morale. To keep calm, and carry on.

              The Second World War involved 61 countries and over 30 million
              soldiers, it was a global event that had devastating consequences.

              Despite its scale, many aren't aware of how it affected everyday

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
              Sunday May 23 1943 was perhaps the worst day of the war in
              Bournemouth. A squadron of the Luftwaffe’s Focke Wulfes had bombed
              the town, leading to a terrible loss of life in just a few
              minutes. It is estimated that the number killed in Bournemouth on
              that day ranged from 70 to 200 people, with the addtion of twenty
              two destroyed buildings and a further 3,354 damaged. Mike Brown
              was just six years old when the bombs hit, whilst his father was
              away fighting at the war. He was playing with his friend when the
              sirens began, but due to the frequent nature of them he continued
              playing. It was not until the sound of the bombs could be felt and
              heard that he decided to run into the house, shortly after his
              mother had been calling for him. The buildings targeted that day
              included Cairns House; West’s Cinema; the Metropole Hotel at the
              Lansdowne; the Central Hotel at Richmond Hill; the Shamrock and
              Rambler coach station at Holdenhurst Road; and Beales department
              store. There had been incidents before, a total of 47. Bombs had
              been dropped, leading to devisation across bournemouth, but it had
              not been as horrific as the events that unfolded on 23 May 1943.
              It is a day that few will forget.

              My name’s Mike Brown I was born in Bournemouth 1937 prior to the
              start of the Second World War. I haven’t moved much anyway as
              where I’m living right now is close to where I was born, as people
              were born in their homes then not in hospital. So I haven’t moved
              to far from where we experienced the Second World War.
            </p>
            <p>
              My father went through Normandy, so obviously dad was away and I
              didn’t see much of him on a regular basis, but he did come home on
              leave sometimes. Dad was involved in the Second World War and we
              were doing what we could at home. Dodging them bombs. Luckily no
              members of my family lost their lives in the war, my Dad and all
              his brothers all fought in the war; Navy and Army. My sisters were
              doing work on the railway.

              I was with the lad next door and the siren went. Of course we were
              used to sirens going, I wouldn’t say we ignored it but sometimes
              it didn’t affect us. We had a general siren for the whole of the
              south of England so we just carried on a bit. Anyway my mum came
              to the French doors of this porch and she said to us that we
              ‘better come on in’. Well we carried on a bit, and while we were
              doing that there were five explosions. Well my little feet went as
              far as they could and I was hammering on the front door before I
              knew it. This is when the planes went right across Bournemouth
              centre. We lost Woolworths, the next one went on Richmond memorial
              church which is on Richmond Hill. Then another one dropped a bomb
              on Beale’s the department store and the next one although there’s
              no sign of it now it was West Pitchers Cinema where my Mum used to
              be work as an usher. The next one was the metropole, which was
              terrible.

              The closest bombs fell in the town centre, I suppose town centre
              from Mooredown is 3 miles but even at that distance we still felt
              it. It was quite a heavy impact and of course we were six years
              old so we had no idea about the explosives, but it was frightening
              to me at that age.
            </p>
            <p>
              At six years old you’re starting to get wise to different things,
              I mean we had an air aid shelter in the bungalow. One of those
              table like designs with metal around them, so we used to get
              inside that. But I wouldn’t say that it was getting blasé, but I
              would say we had a rough idea as to what was going on. Obviously
              my Dad was disappearing off for periods of time which was
              obviously something I clearly recorded in my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              We had bombs all around; it wasn’t just five bombs I think. I read
              that on that particular day 16 aircraft were involved not
              necessarily in bombing the Metropole but they were definitely
              attacking the area, so it wasn’t until after the day that details
              started to come in.

            <p>
              The bombs left lots of holes all round different areas I mean it
              wasn’t just the centres. I mean a lot of places in the residential
              area were bombed as well, I mean on one particular raid a landmine
              went down on one of the schools that my mother attended on Alma
              Road. I’m not sure of the force of it but a lot of buildings in
              the surrounding area were affected by it, because this was a
              landmine, a big bomb, it damaged a lot of buildings all through
              the town.
            </p>
            <p>
              At six years of age I was only affected by the actual bombs
              dropping, it did mean that we didn’t travel to far though as
              sometimes the infrastructure for travel was sometimes disrupted. I
              know there was a big hole where Woolworths used to be for a good
              few years after it was bombed. We had tanks with machine guns
              rolling through the town, and planes that came up from a certain
              airport that was right behind North of Bournemouth, probably a
              reason for them targeting the area. This airport would probably
              have been quite an interesting place for the Germans with all the
              fighter planes being stored there.
            </p>
            <p>
              I suppose we got a bit blasé, we used to collect shrapnel. Because
              for everything that went up and exploded, well there was a lot of
              it coming down as well. Well anyways just a ways next to the
              school that I attended there was a wood and all of the Americans
              getting ready for D-Day were stationed there. We used to go up
              there as the tanks were going by on the road, we used to say ‘got
              any gum chap’ and the yanks used to chuck us some.

            <p>
              The Second World War involved 61 countries and over 30 million
              soldiers, it was a global event that had devastating consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite its scale, many aren't aware of how it affected everyday
              peoples lives. One reason that has been given for this is that
              technology has distracted people from reality.

            <h6>Bournemouth on 23rd of May 1943</h6>
            <ul style="text-align: left">
              <li>
                131 men and women are confirmed to have lost their lives on that
                day, though the total deathtoll is thought to be somewhere over
                200. Hundreds more suffered life changing injuries.
              </li>
              <li>
                22 buildings were destroyed in the raid, the Metropole in
                Lansdowne and Central Hotel at thebottom of Richmond Hill.
              </li>
              <li>
                3359 Buildings were damaged in some shape or form leading to 37
                of them being demolished in the aftermath.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the 23rd of May 1943 the air raid sirens sounded at 12.54pm,
                with the first bomb dropping seconds before the clocks struck 1.
                Bournemouth was blindsided as the authorities normally gave a
                full 22 minutes of warning upon detection of enemy aircraft.
              </li>
              <li>
                A single bomb was responsible for the deaths of 54 people at
                Central Hotel.

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>
              Vernon Masterman had always lived in Bournemouth, and remained in
              his childhood house even after it had been damaged from
              Bournemouth bombings in 1943. He was a mere 4 and a half years old
              when he was playing in his backyard lawn whilst his father was
              gardening and mother cooking the sunday roast. After hearing loud
              noises, he looked up to find a large group of planes flying
              overhead. His mother came and grabbed his arm, rushing towards the
              air raid shelter that was further down the street.
            </p>
            <p>
              They didn't make it to the shelter as they were stopped by flying
              debris from a blast at the side of the neighbouring building. They
              were trapped under the building for hours whilst they waited to be
              dug out. The bomb was aimed at the nerby railway bridge, but had
              ricochet across the town before detonating next door. Ever sincee
              these harrowing events, the smell of rubble and burnt building
              structures still remind him of the day those many years ago. Being
              a child, his memories of the war were an adventure, he had no
              fear. Despite the awful events, Vernon still remembers the fun he
              had across the area as a child, but the reminders of the war still
              remain.

              Well I was actually born in this house, so I was 4 and a half
              years old and I was playing just on the lawn there with I think a
              box of sand or something, and I heard a noise and looked up. My
              father was up the garden, gardening, my mother was cooking the
              Sunday dinner and looked around over there. There was about 7
              planes coming in really apparently I didn’t know until later there
              was probably 20 odd but they divided into 3 batches. And with
              that, mother came and grabbed me and went out through the gate to
              an air raid shelter which was just on the other side.
            </p>

            <p>
              Well we never got there because she saw sort of the blast come in
              past the edge of the building so she stopped dead and the building
              collapsed around us, trapping us there for several hours till we
              were dug out. The bomb was not actually aimed for this spot, it
              actually aimed for the railway bridge and it ricochet on the slope
              of the bridge and ricochet took off again and there was a co-op
              bakery which was that block of flats over there. And it ricochets
              through the roof across here and it detonated next door. That’s
              why there are three or four new houses or fairly new houses there.
              Anyway; the buildings collapsed around us, we were trapped and the
              side of our house was blown out, eventually we were dug out. I can
              vaguely remember everything seemed to be pink, it was some memory
              of pinkness while I was in there and ever since then the smell of
              rubble, of a building being pulled down gets in my nostrils and
              that’s a feeling that has always stayed with me for that day.

              That’s the bit I remember, a crew came to dig us out and the
              Salvation Army turned up with a mobile canteen, so I stood outside
              and for several hours eating ham rolls. But luckily my uncle has a
              little haulage business, he got most of his furniture taken up to
              his place and stored, so some of our furniture got stored as well.
              After that I slept at my grandmother’s for the night and a few
              days later we moved into a requisition property, so we went in
              with several other families, and shared a large house for 5 months
              before returning to our house as we managed to get the building
              repaired.
            </p>

            <p>
              The other buildings were completely destroyed. The amazing thing
              was the house next door where the air raid shelter was completely
              flattened. When it was all cleared the only thing that remained
              standing was the outside toilet, hence the expression, built like
              a brick outhouse. That was it.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was one young girl, she was in the air raid shelter and she
              actually returned to the house to get her dog but she died. And
              there was another person but I don’t quite recall them as I was
              very young. The girl ‘Betty’ was only 17, she got killed and she
              was buried in Boscombe cemetery. That was about it I think.

              I’d probably have called it an adventure as a child because as a
              child you seem to have no fear. I know my cousin who now lives on
              the Isle of Wight said she’ll never forget seeing me that day as
              she only lived a few roads away. She said they dug me out all
              covered in powder and rubble and dust. Strangely enough it had had
              an effect on my life, not in any respect but with a different
              context as a result of going into the council rehousing me. My
              father became friends with the housing manager, he ended up giving
              me the chance to have an apprenticeship as a carpenter and that
              sort of made, set my life up, a stepping stone in my life.

              Residents stayed mainly the same after the war around here,
              several other houses had damage but they basically stayed the
              same. It was only in the later years that people had started
              moving on and all. But my father’s shop was a shoe shop and that
              remained a shoe shop for many years. Next door was an ire mongers
              and the house again was a café. Those businesses moved up onto the
              main road, they never returned to commercial premise, that was a
              result of the bombing raid here. Nothing really changed in that
              respect.

              The only other thing I can remember further on in the war was
              D-day, when the sky was black with air crafts going over to
              Normandy beaches, it was absolutely black that morning. And I
              could always remember my father saying somebody’s getting a packet
              today and that was about it. And apart from the cinema up the road
              burning out was probably the last air raid that rocky picture
              house at the top of the road had an incendiary bomb dropped in, in
              1944 I believe that was probably the last air raid on Bournemouth.
            </p>

            <p>
              But the one on the 23rd of May was a massive one, the place was
              really targeted as opposed to the occasional bombs being dropped
              from aircraft returning from the south midlands back across to the
              channel. Incidentally; Hastings was targeted as well on the same
              day May the 23rd 1943 though I don’t think Hastings had as much
              devastation as Bournemouth. They were two identical, what they
              call, tip and run raids.

              I didn’t realise how much devastation it had caused elsewhere in
              the town because I never moved from the spot. The next building
              down the road was bombed, incidentally I found out after about 4 –
              5 years ago that my wife’s best friend; her aunt, as well as her
              cousin were killed in the same place down the road. There’s a
              photo of that devastation but I could never yet find a photo of
              this spot.

            <p>
              One thing that was built after the war here was a static water
              tank next door, which was a large tank probably metal with a
              concrete base around 6-foot-high, full of water for fire purposes
              if there was further bombing. And they had that, so that if the
              water mains got blown up, the fire brigade had water that they
              could pump on fires. But that was put temporarily next door. It
              ended up as a good play site for us kids, that area of land there.
              We had fun out there for years until they rebuilt. But then we’d
              grown up out of playing around then.

              My original house was actually made up of two houses, when we were
              bombed we made it into one. My father had one staircase taken out,
              and knocked a doorway through downstairs as well as upstairs. So
              basically we had many outside doors, we had two front doors that
              was why sometimes you didn’t know which side of the house to come
              in, and it was a shop as well. I think the other people never came
              back; they only had maybe a room or two up above on one side
              because the shop occupied most of that side of the property. So
              the result of the bombing was the conversion of this house from
              two houses to one.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite all that, I’ve never felt like moving from this house.
              It’s so handy being here. I know it’s not reputed as being a good
              area but it’s so handy, you’ve got the station, the beach, the
              main road; you can be away down in the town in minutes, or go
              straight over into Boscombe. Plus there’s a lovely little pub up
              the road. I’m content here, I think they’d have to carry me out.

              The Second World War involved 61 countries and over 30 million
              soldiers, it was a global event that had devastating consequences.

            <p>
              Despite its scale, many aren't aware of how it affected everyday
              peoples lives. One reason that has been given for this is that
              technology has distracted people from reality.

            <h6>Bournemouth on 23rd of May 1943</h6>
            <ul style="text-align: left">
              <li>
                131 men and women are confirmed to have lost their lives on that
                day, though the total deathtoll is thought to be somewhere over
                200. Hundreds more suffered life changing injuries.
              </li>
              <li>
                22 buildings were destroyed in the raid, the Metropole in
                Lansdowne and Central Hotel at thebottom of Richmond Hill.
              </li>
              <li>
                3359 Buildings were damaged in some shape or form leading to 37
                of them being demolished in the aftermath.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the 23rd of May 1943 the air raid sirens sounded at 12.54pm,
                with the first bomb dropping seconds before the clocks struck 1.
                Bournemouth was blindsided as the authorities normally gave a
                full 22 minutes of warning upon detection of enemy aircraft.
              </li>
              <li>
                A single bomb was responsible for the deaths of 54 people at
                Central Hotel.
