# Bournemouth Bombings

A non-linear interactive documentary experience around the Bombings of Bournemouth on the 23rd of May 1943.

Created as part of a university brief to create a non-linear experience. We decided to create it around a local story, the bombings of bournemouth in 1943, interviewing members of the local community who remembered the events.

We decided to create a web-based application on the premise that everyone consumes media differently and sometimes people like to switch between stories and experience the story at their own pace, from different view points.

## The project

The code is quite old now and hasn't been updated, I will at some point go back to this and have already experiemnted with using a dynamic app-like experience using a database and AJAX.

You're welcome to downlaod and review this code. However, I do ask that you reference this original project alongside any of your uses of the code.

Feedback on the project is welcome, as are pull requests and code reviews (although the code is a mess so there isn't much point).

If you really like it and would like to support me and any of my other projects, feel free to [support my next cup of coffee](https://monzo.me/jamiedanieldevivo) ☺️♥️
